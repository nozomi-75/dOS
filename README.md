# About DildOS Linux
DildOS Linux is built by Scented Orange using Debian utilities. To put it simply, it is Debian with added TDE repos, along with some tweaks to ensure operation on most hardware platforms. There are also some changes made to the default Trinity session for an overall solid desktop experience.
